# PDF Preview & Rename

A lightweight Python tool which scans a folder for PDF files, displays them and allows the user to easily rename them.

I wrote this tool to sort my scanned documents.

## Requirements

* pdf2image
* tkinter
* pillow

## Usage

Currently the tool (file ´pdfRenamer.py´ and ´main.py´) needs to be moved to the folder with your PDF documents and executed from there (using Python 3). Rest should be self-explaining.
